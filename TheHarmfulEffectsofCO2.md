# The True Effects of Emissions
The project focuses on the broad spectrum of emissions across the globe and who is contributing the most versus the least throughout history. The information considers the country, years, and integer values of each emission consumed. In addressing the issues of the harmful effects of CO2 emissions across the globe, we can already see the negative outcomes it has throughout the world through more frequent fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, etc. In finding the issue, we will use data set to back up the claim. I will use methods of finding the top emitters, graphing them on histograms, box plots, and time plots to see the distribution of CO2 emissions in the last decades. The conclusion of the project will give valuable insight into the changes and regulations that need to be instilled throughout our world. Especially with China leading the issue, we need a way to find a solution to the world's current problem.   
## Data Section
The source of the data set comes from "pabloarosado" (https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-data.csv) and downloaded at 1:30 pm, March 29, 2023. 
## Data Processing 
1) The steps to clean the data, we first imported the dataset given in the Github and into the Colab Notebook
2) Specifying 'non-coutnries' listed in the Colab notebook, I used "df = df.loc[df['country'].isin(non_countries) == False]" to remove all the non-countries that do not need to be addressed as we move forward throughout the notebook.
